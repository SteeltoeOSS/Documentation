# Documentation

## Overview

This is the home of Steeltoe documentation and blog articles. The site uses [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx) to convert markdown to html as well site navigation. To get the docfx cli visit [this](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html) page to see the different distributions.

If you are using VS Code as your editor, there is a [super sweet plugin for docfx](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintoy.docfx-assistant). All it really does is discover `UID`'s and provide intellisense with the `@` char is typed in markdown.

Also you can use *most* of the features included in Microsoft's [docs authoring pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docsmsft.docs-authoring-pack).

## Folders

- /api: holds the project documentation markdown and table of contents
  - /v2: version 2 documentation
  - /v3: version 3 documentation
- /apidoc: in the future this will hold generated api docs from src
- /articles: holds the markdown for blog posts
- /images: the images
- /template/steeltoe: odd files that overwrite the default docfx theme

## Markdown parser

Docfx offers a custom flavor of markdown with quite a few enhanced capabilities. To see examples and learn more, view the [docfx specifications](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/docfx_flavored_markdown.html?tabs=tabid-1%2Ctabid-a).

### Links and Cross References

As you get familiar with docfx you'll notice the addition of a yaml header in the markdown files. Values in this header let you control page design as well as set the pages `UID`. With this you can create `xref` as well as use docfx's `@` shorthand. Lean more about [linking in docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/links_and_cross_references.html). **Note** is should be very rare that you hard code a link to an 'html' page with your markdown. Instead use it's `UID` and let the path get calculated as well links get validated when building the project.

## Creating a new blog post

Create a new `.md` file in the `articles` folder. Name the file something authentic that is URL safe. Then in `/articles/index.md` include a shorthand link to the document as well as a short description. If the post should also be included in Steeltoe's rss feed, add a link entry in `articles/rss.xml`.

Here is a starter blog post:

```markdown
---
type: markdown
title: My Very Authentic Blog Post Title
_description: A short description about my topic. Maybe 2 sentences long.
description: A short description about my topic. Maybe 2 sentences long.
date: 01/01/2000

# My Very Authentic Blog Post Title

Let's talk about something really cool...
```

## Creating a new api document

Similar to the blog post you're going to create a new markdown file, but in the `api` folder. The name needs to be URL safe. Notice in the api folder there is a `v2` and `v3` subfolder. Within each of those are folder for each component. Place your content accordingly. To include the file in the table of contents, add it in `api/(version)/toc.yml`. Notice in the examples below that the `topicHref` are not absolute paths. Docfx will calculate everything at build time.
An example api doc:

```markdown
---
uid: api/v2/circuitbreaker/hystrix
---

# Netflix Hystrix

Steeltoe's Hystrix implementation lets application developers isolate and manage back-end dependencies so that a single failing dependency does not take down the entire application. This is accomplished by wrapping all calls to external dependencies in a `HystrixCommand`, which runs in its own...

Here is an example cross reference link to config docs: @api/v2/configuration/cloud-foundry-provider
Or you could link to the v3 version of this doc: @api/v3/circuitbreaker/hystrix
Or do the same thing by provide custom link text: [view the v3 version](xref:api/v2/circuitbreaker/hystrix)
```

Corresponding entry in api/v2/toc.yml:

```yml
- name: Circuit Breakers
  items:
    - topicHref: circuitbreaker/hystrix.md
      name: Hystrix
```

## Page display options

In the yaml header of a page's markdown, you have options to turn page elements on or off. Below are those options.

|Yaml label  |Default value  |Description   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|_disableToc     |false|Turn off the left had table of contents         |
|_disableAffix     |false|Turn off the right hand page navigation links         |
|_disableContribution     |false|Turn off right hand link to "edit this page"         |
|_disableFooter     |false|Don't show footer when guest scrolls to page bottom         |
|_enableSearch     |true|Show the search icon         |
|_enableNewTab     |true|All links on the page open in a new browser tab         |
|_disableNav     |false|Do not show top navigation links         |
|_hideTocVersionToggle|false     |Hide the version toggler in the table of contents         |
|_noindex     |false|Do not let search engines index the page         |
|_disableNavbar|false     |Do not show top bar of page         |

## Building the site

Use docfx's [user manual](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx.exe_user_manual.html), to build and run the site in a few different ways. The simplest way is to `cd` into the root folder of this project and run the following command. The site will build in a temp folder named `_site` and be served at http://localhost:8080.

```powershell
docfx build --serve --port 8082
```

You can also specify where the build output should land

```powershell
docfx build -o "../publish"
```

## Base host address

By default the navigation links will use the live site (https://steeltoe.io) as the base host address. You can override that by including the applicable metadata file.

If running the MainSite locally on port 8080, then use the localServer metadata file.

```powershell
docfx build --serve --port 8082 --globalMetadataFiles "localServer.json" --logLevel Warning
```

If running the MainSite locally with the dev site, then use the dev metadata file.

```powershell
docfx build --serve --port 8082 --globalMetadataFiles "dev.json" --logLevel Warning
```

## Updating Generated API Docs

The contents of the folder `/api/browser` were generated by running `docfx metadata <json file>` from this directory, with the Steeltoe 2.x and 3.x source code cloned into the same directory as this repository.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Steeltoe.git --branch 3.0.2
git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Steeltoe.git --branch 2.5.2 Steeltoe2x

docfx metadata api-v2.json && docfx metadata api-v3.json && docfx metadata api-all.json
```

```bash
- BasePath
  - Documentation
  - Steeltoe
  - Steeltoe2x
```
