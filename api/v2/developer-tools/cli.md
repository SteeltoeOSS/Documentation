# Steeltoe CLI 
Steeltoe CLI simplifies the process of running and deploying Steeltoe applications.  With this tooling you can, with minimal commands, run your application locally while also being able to easily deploy to Kubernetes or Cloud Foundry.

There are 3 basic steps when using Steeltoe Tooling:

1. Initialize Steeltoe Tooling configuration defaults
1. Add an application and its services to the configuration
1. Deploy the application and its services locally, to Kubernetes, or to Cloud Foundry

## Getting Started

### Install Steeltoe Tooling

Steeltoe Tooling is a [DotNet Global Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) console executable named `st`.  Use `dotnet tool install` to install.

```sh
$ dotnet tool install --global --version 0.5.0 Steeltoe.Cli
```

### Add DotNet Global Tools to your PATH Variable

DotNet Global Tools are installed in an OS-dependent user directory.

|OS|Path|
|---|---|
|Windows|`%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools`|
|OS X/Linux|`$HOME/.dotnet/tools`|

After adding of the above paths to your `PATH` env var, you can run the `st` executable.

```sh
$ st --version
1.0.0-m1
```


## Usage of Tooling CLI

### Initialization

The `st init` command initializes your project for Steeltoo Tooling.  Enter your project directory and run the command.

```sh
$ cd MyProject
$ st init
Initialized Steeltoe Developer Tools
```

Running `st init` creates the file `steeltoe.yaml` in your project directory.  Steeltoe Tooling uses this file to determine what application and services are to be deployed and where to deploy them.

### Application and Services

The `st add-app`, `st add-service`, and `st remove` commands add and remove applications and services to the Steeltoe Tooling configuration.

#### Adding an Application

Running `st add-app <appname>` adds an application to the configuration. _appname_ must correspond to a `.csproj` file of the same name.

```sh
$ st add-app MyProject
Added app 'MyProject'
```

#### Adding a Service

Running `st add-service <svctype> <svcname>` adds a service to the configuration.

Supported service types include:

|Service Type|Description|
|---|---|
|config-server|Cloud Foundry Config Server|
|eureka-server|Netflix Eureka Server|
|hystrix-dashboard|Netflix Hystrix Dashboard|
|mssql|Microsoft SQL Server|
|mysql|MySQL Server|
|postgresql|PostgreSQL Server|
|rabbitmq|RabbitMQ Message Broker|
|redis|Redis In-Memory Datastore|
|zipkin|Zipkin Tracing Collector and UI|

```sh
$ st add-service config-server MyConfigServer
Added config-server service 'MyConfigServer'
```

#### Removing an Application or Service

Running `st remove <name>` removes the named application or service.

```sh
$ st remove myConfigServer
Removed config-server service 'myConfigServer'
```

### Deployment

#### Setting the Target

Running `st target <target>` targets a deployment.

Supported targets include:

|Target|Deployment Destination|
|---|---|
|cloud-foundry|current Cloud Foundry space|
|docker|local Docker host|
|kubernetes|current Kubernetes context|

```sh
$ st target kubernetes
Kubernetes ... kubectl client version 1.14, server version 1.14
current context ... docker-desktop
Target set to 'kubernetes'
```

#### Deploying

Running `st deploy` deploys an application and its services to the current target.

```sh
$ st deploy
Deploying service 'myConfigServer'
Waiting for service 'myConfigServer' to come online (1)
Waiting for service 'myConfigServer' to come online (2)
Deploying app 'SimpleCloudFoundry'
```

#### Undeploying

Running `st undeploy` undeploys an application and its services from the current target.

```sh
$ st undeploy
Undeploying app 'SimpleCloudFoundry'
Undeploying service 'myConfigServer'
```

## An Example Using Tooling

In this sample we use Steeltoe Tooling to simplify the process of deploying the Steeltoe Sample Redis Connector project to various targets.

### Initialize the Redis Connector Project Dev Environment

Checkout Steeltoe Samples and navigate to the Redis Connector sample.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples.git
$ cd Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/Redis
```

Initialize Steeltoe Tooling.

```sh
$ st init
Initialized Steeltoe Developer Tools
```

### Add the Application and Service

Add application.
```sh
$ st add-app Redis
Added app 'Redis' (netcoreapp3.1/win10-x64)
```

Add service.
```sh
$ st add-service redis myRedisService
Added redis service 'myRedisService'
```

### Deploy

#### Deploy Locally (Docker)

Before deploying to a remote cloud, first run locally using Docker ...

```sh
$ st target docker
Docker ... Docker version 18.09.1, build 4c52b90
Docker host OS ... Docker for Mac
Docker container OS ... linux
Target set to 'docker'
```

... create a DotNet Configuration file named `appsettings.Docker.json` ...

```sh
$ cat appsettings.Docker.json
{
  "redis": {
    "client": {
      "host": "myRedisService",
      "port": "6379"
    }
  }
}
```

... deploy to Docker ...

```
$ st deploy
Deploying service 'myRedisService'
Deploying app 'Redis'
```

... check status ...

```sh
$ st status
myRedisService online
Redis online
```

... then navigate to application ...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<http://localhost:8080/>

... finally, undeploy.

```sh
$ st undeploy
Undeploying app 'Redis'
Undeploying service 'myRedisService'
```

#### Deploy to Cloud Foundry

Deploy to Cloud Foundry ...

```sh
$ st target cloud-foundry
Cloud Foundry ... cf version 6.46.0+29d6257f1.2019-07-09
logged into Cloud Foundry ... yes
Target set to 'cloud-foundry'

$ st deploy
Deploying service 'myRedisService'
Deploying app 'Redis'
```

... check status ...

```sh
$ st status
myRedisService online
Redis online
```

... and undeploy.

```sh
$ st undeploy
Undeploying app 'Redis'
Undeploying service 'myRedisService'
```

#### Deploy to Kubernetes

If you haven't already, create a DotNet Configuration file named `appsettings.Docker.json` as in the Docker example above ...

... deploy to Kubernetes ...

```sh
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)  # if using minikube's Docker

$ st target kubernetes
Kubernetes ... kubectl client version 1.15, server version 1.15
current context ... minikube
Target set to 'kubernetes'

$ st deploy
Deploying service 'myRedisService'
Waiting for 'myRedisService' to transition to online (1)
Waiting for 'myRedisService' to transition to online (2)
Waiting for 'myRedisService' to transition to online (3)
Deploying app 'Redis'
Waiting for 'Redis' to transition to online (1)
Waiting for 'Redis' to transition to online (2)
Waiting for 'Redis' to transition to online (3)
Waiting for 'Redis' to transition to online (4)
```

... check status ...

```sh
$ st status
myRedisService online
Redis online
```

... enable port-forwarding to the app running in Kubernetes ...

```sh
# determine pod name
$ kubectl get pods --selector app=redis
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-57fc6b5c85-9n4z9   1/1     Running   0          87s

# forward port 8080 to pod
$ kubectl port-forward redis-57fc6b5c85-9n4z9 8080:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 80
...
```

... then navigate to application ...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<http://localhost:8080/>

... and undeploy.

```sh
$ st undeploy
Undeploying app 'Redis'
Undeploying service 'myRedisService'
```
