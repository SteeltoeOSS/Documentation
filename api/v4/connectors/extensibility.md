# Extensibility

Connectors were redesigned in Steeltoe v4, and extensibility is not yet available.
We intend to address this gap in the near future. Please follow along and add any input you may have on [this issue](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Steeltoe/issues/1154).

See [Advanced settings](usage.md#advanced-settings) to customize the built-in Connectors.
