# Dynamic Logging

Steeltoe includes two logging providers that enhance existing logger libraries with support for managing minimum log levels at runtime through the [Steeltoe Management logger endpoint](../management/loggers.md) and [recording distributed trace information](../tracing/index.md#log-correlation).

* [Dynamic Console Logging](./dynamic-console-logging.md) works with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console`.
* [Dynamic Serilog Logging](./dynamic-serilog-logging.md) works with `Serilog`
