# Exporting Distributed Traces

Steeltoe is able to automatically configure several exporters provided by the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) project, including [Zipkin](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Zipkin), [Jaeger](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Jaeger) and [OpenTelemetryProtocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol), if a NuGet reference to the desired exporter is included. The `Steeltoe.Management.ExporterBase` and `Steeltoe.Management.ExporterCore` packages are no longer required. In addition, Steeltoe supports exporting traces to [TanzuObservability](https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability) without any other NuGet references.

## Common Settings

As of version 3.1.0, the exporter settings class has been merged with [tracing settings](./index.md#configure-settings). This table includes settings that are only relevant to exporting traces:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ExporterEndpoint` | Defines an endpoint traces should be sent to. | not set |
| `MaxPayloadSizeInBytes` | Maximum payload size to export, in bytes. | 4096 |
| `UseShortTraceIds` | Whether to truncate the IDs to 8 bytes instead of 16. Used for backwards compatibility. | `false` |

**Note**: **Each setting above must be prefixed with `Management:Tracing`**

## Zipkin Server

Zipkin is a popular distributed tracing system that has been around for several years. It is composed of client libraries for instrumenting application code and a backend server for collecting and viewing the collected data. For more information on Zipkin, we encourage you to review the [documentation](https://zipkin.io/). See the [Quickstart](https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart) guide for details on how to set up a server.

### Configure Zipkin Options

In addition to the [common exporter settings](#common-settings), you may configure ExportProcessorType and BatchExportProcessorOptions in code:

```csharp
services.PostConfigure<ZipkinExporterOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ExportProcessorType = ExportProcessorType.Batch;
    options.BatchExportProcessorOptions.ExporterTimeoutMilliseconds = 1000;
});
```

### Use Zipkin Exporter

Steeltoe will discover and automatically configure the Zipkin exporter when a standard NuGet reference is used:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Zipkin" Version="1.1.0-rc1" />
```

## Jaeger Server

Jaeger is another popular distributed tracing system that has been around for several years. For more information on Jaeger, we encourage you to visit the [Jaeger site](https://www.jaegertracing.io/). See the [Getting Started](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.24/getting-started/) guide for details on how to quickly set up a server.

### Configure Jaeger Options

In addition to the [common exporter settings](#common-settings), you may configure ExportProcessorType and BatchExportProcessorOptions in code:

```csharp
services.PostConfigure<JaegerExporterOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ExportProcessorType = ExportProcessorType.Batch;
    options.BatchExportProcessorOptions.ExporterTimeoutMilliseconds = 1000;
});
```

### Use Jaeger Exporter

Steeltoe will discover and automatically configure the Jaeger exporter when a standard NuGet reference is used:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Jaeger" Version="1.1.0-rc1" />
```

## Open Telemetry Protocol

The OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) is a vendor-agnostic way to export traces. Steeltoe will configure [this exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol) to communicate to an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) through a gRPC protocol.

### Configure Open Telemetry Protocol Options

In addition to the [common exporter settings](#common-settings), you may configure Headers, ExportProcessorType and BatchExportProcessorOptions in code:

```csharp
services.PostConfigure<OtlpExporterOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ExportProcessorType = ExportProcessorType.Batch;
    options.BatchExportProcessorOptions.ExporterTimeoutMilliseconds = 1000;
});
```

### Use Open Telemetry Protocol Exporter

Steeltoe will discover and automatically configure the Open Telemetry Protocol exporter when a standard NuGet reference is used:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol" Version="1.1.0-rc1" />
```

## Tanzu Observability by Wavefront

[Tanzu Observability](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_introduction.html) is an observability platform for distributed applications that can ingest metric & trace data. A free trial is available [here](https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability-trial) to try it.

### Use Wavefront Exporter (Tanzu Observability)

Steeltoe will automatically send traces to Wavefront if the following settings are provided. Note that these are shared between tracing and metrics and the Wavefront Trace exporter is activated by the presence of a valid `Uri` and `ApiToken` combination. 

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ApiToken` | Your Tanzu Observability [API Token](https://docs.wavefront.com/users_account_managing.html#generate-an-api-token) | not set |
| `Uri` | The Uri of your Wavefront Instance | not set |
| `Step` | The interval between reporting to Wavefront  | 30000  |
| `BatchSize` | The max batch of data sent per flush interval | 10000 |
| `MaxQueueSize` |  the size of internal buffer beyond which data is dropped | 500000

**Note**: **Each setting above must be prefixed with `Management:Metrics:Export:Wavefront`**

If using the a proxy, the `apiToken` is not needed and the `uri` would be `proxy://<ProxyHost>:<ProxyPort>`

In addition, the following settings can be used to set the application and service names:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Source`| Unique identifier for the app instance that is publishing metrics to Wavefront | DNS name 
| `Name` | Name of the application | SteeltoeApp |
| `Service` | Name of the service | SteeltoeService |

**Note**: **Each setting above must be prefixed with `Wavefront:Application`**
