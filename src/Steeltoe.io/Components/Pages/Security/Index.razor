<Template Name="Security" Features="@_features" DocsUrl="/docs/security" MetaDescription="Use Steeltoe to facilitate authentication and authorization with Cloud Foundry security services.">
    <Description>
        Securing your applications and microservices using the security services provided by cloud platforms can seem like an impossible and complex development effort.
        Steeltoe reduces that effort by including security providers which enable you to easily integrate ASP.NET Core authentication and authorization features with Cloud Foundry security services.
    </Description>
    <WhatIs>
        Applications must have some notion of security, but you don&apos;t want to lock the app in to a certain provider.
        Instead, use the native functions of .NET and let the platform decide the provider.
        Cloud Security helps your app achieve that abstraction.
    </WhatIs>
    <WhyUse>Steeltoe provides a number of Security-related services that simplify using a cloud platform&apos;s security services in ASP.NET applications.</WhyUse>
