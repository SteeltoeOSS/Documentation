    <Description>
        Developing distributed systems can be challenging. Complexity is moved from the application layer to the network layer and demands greater interaction between services.
        Making your code &apos;cloud-native&apos; means dealing with <Href href="https://12factor.net" NewWindow="true">12-factor</Href> issues such as external configuration, statelessness, logging, and connecting to backing services.
        Steeltoe with Spring Cloud suite of projects contains many of the services you need to make your applications run in the cloud.
