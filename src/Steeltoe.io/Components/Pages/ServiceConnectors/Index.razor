<Template Name="Service Connectors" Features="@_features" DocsUrl="/docs/connectors" MetaDescription="Use Steeltoe to ease the transition from locally-hosted services to bound services in your cloud hosted environment.">
    <Description>
        One of the many advantages of running applications on the cloud is the easy availability of a variety of backing services.
        Steeltoe simplifies using those services by automatically configuring and wiring up connections to common services like Redis, RabbitMQ, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and more.
    </Description>
    <WhatIs>
        Backing services are must when creating cloud-native .NET applications, but managing the connections can be time-consuming and annoying.
        Steeltoe Service Connectors takes that pain away and let you get back to doing what you love.
    </WhatIs>
	<WhyUse>
        Steeltoe Connectors provide out-of-the-box support for discovering many common services on a cloud platform.
        They also include the ability to use settings-based configuration so that developers can supply configuration settings at development and testing time but then have those settings be overridden when pushing the application to the platform.
