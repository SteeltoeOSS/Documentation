<Template Name="Messaging" Features="@_features" DocsUrl="/docs/messaging" MetaDescription="Use Steeltoe Messaging to build event-driven applications.">
    <Description>Build highly scalable event-driven microservices connected to shared messaging systems.</Description>
    <WhatIs>
        The Steeltoe Messaging project applies core .NET concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions.
        It provides a "template" as a high-level abstraction for sending and receiving messages. It also provides support for Message-driven POCOs with a "listener container".
        These libraries facilitate management of AMQP resources while promoting the use of dependency injection and declarative configuration.
