## Using Service Connectors with RabbitMQ

This tutorial takes you through setting up a .NET Core application with the RabbitMQ service connector.

> [!NOTE]
> For more detailed examples, please refer to the [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/main/Connectors/src/RabbitMQ) project in the [Steeltoe Samples Repository](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples).

First, **start a RabbitMQ instance** using the [Steeltoe dockerfile](https://github.com/steeltoeoss/dockerfiles).

```powershell
docker run --publish 5672:5672 steeltoeoss/rabbitmq
```

Next, **create a .NET Core WebAPI** that interacts with RabbitMQ

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core WebAPI app with the [Steeltoe Initializr](https://start.steeltoe.io)

1. Name the project "RabbitMQConnector"
1. Add the "RabbitMQ" dependency
1. Click **Generate** to download a zip containing the new project
1. Extract the zipped project and open in your IDE of choice
1. Validate the correct logging level is set in **appsettings.json**

   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Debug",
         "System": "Information",
         "Microsoft": "Information",
         "Steeltoe": "Debug",
         "RabbitMQ_Connector": "Debug"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure the correct logging is set or you'll miss the output. The default logging level should be set to `Information`.

1. Set the instance address in **appsettings.json**

   ```json
   {
     "rabbitmq": {
       "client": {
         "server": "127.0.0.1",
         "port": "5672",
         "username": "guest",
         "password": "guest"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > If you would like to see how to customize the connection have a look at the [docs](~/api/v3/welcome/index.md)

**Run** the application

# [.NET cli](#tab/cli)

```powershell
dotnet run <PATH_TO>\RabbitMQConnector.csproj
```

Navigate to the endpoint (you may need to change the port number) [http://localhost:5000/api/values](http://localhost:5000/api/values)

# [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

1. Choose the top _Debug_ menu, then choose _Start Debugging (F5)_. This should bring up a browser with the app running
1. Navigate to the endpoint (you may need to change the port number) [http://localhost:8080/api/values](http://localhost:8080/api/values)

---

As the app loads in the browser it will create a message queue, listen for new messages on the queue, and write 5 messages. Once finished the output will let you know everything has completed - "Wrote 5 message to the info log. Have a look!". Looking at the app logs (console) you will see...

```bash
Received message: Message 1
Received message: Message 2
Received message: Message 3
Received message: Message 4
Received message: Message 5
```
