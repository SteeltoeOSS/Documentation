# Workshop summary

The previous labs were meant to show you the power of Steeltoe with microservices. If you feel like you didn't get to write much code or this was too simple then we've done our job! The purpose of Steeltoe is to make your life developing microservices easy. If you had a bunch of convoluted steps and classes to create just to get some supporting framework going that wouldn't be much value added to your day. We've visited actuators, cloud connectors, and external configuration in this workshop. You can continue the learning and exploration of Steeltoe with the below resources. If this is the first time you've used Steeltoe you're missing out on circuit breakers, service discovery, kubernetes things, messaging, and oAuth security goodness. Keep the love going and the .NET learning strong!
