# Exploring all actuators

## Goal

See all actuators running and learn what options are available.

## Expected Results

Enhance the app created in the previous exercise to enable all actuator endpoints.

## Get Started

Open "Program.cs" and replace the 3 Steeltoe 'Add' statements with the single 'all actuators' statement.

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
	Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
		.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder => {
			webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
		})

		//Steeltoe actuators
		.AddAllActuators()

    //Steeltoe dynamic logging
    .AddDynamicLogging()
		;
```

Expose all the actuator endpoints for debugging and demonstration purposes in "appsettings.json". Append the below json just after the "AllowedHosts" line (should be around line 10). And save the file.

```json
,"management": {
  "endpoints": {
    "actuator": {
      "exposure": {
        "include": [ "*" ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Run the application

With all actuators implemented in host builder, we are ready to see everything in action. Run the application.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

Clicking the `Debug > Start Debugging` top menu item. You may be prompted to "trust the IIS Express SSL certificate" and install the certificate. It's safe, trust us. Once started your default browser should open and automatically load the weather forecast endpoint.

![vs-run-application]

# [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

Executing the below command will start the application. You will see a log message written telling how to navigate to the application. It should be [http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast](http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast).

```powershell
dotnet run
```

---

With the application running and the weather forecast endpoint loaded your browser should show the following

![run-weatherforecast]

## Discover all the management endpoints

Load the base actuator endpoint by replacing `WeatherForecast` with `actuator` in the browser address bar.

What exactly has happened? In the previous exercise only select endpoints where implemented and we visited each in the browser to see their output. There was no need to expose those endpoints because Steeltoe doesn't secure them (you can [if you want](/api/v3/management/using-endpoints.html#exposing-endpoints)). With the addition of all endpoints, most are secured by default. You pick & choose which should be exposed and with what roles. Here's a list of each endpoint that is available and it's purpose. While the application is running visit each one to learn more.

- `/actuator`: A json structured list of all actuator endpoints that have been exposed.
- `/actuator/env`: A listing of all environment variables that are available to the app.
- `/actuator/health`: The current health status of the app as reported in IHealthContributor, customized for different platforms.
- `/actuator/info`: Various app information collected from the IInfoContributor.
- `/actuator/loggers`: View and configure the logging levels of your application at runtime. This endpoints supports POST requests to adjust logging levels.
- `/actuator/mappings`: Details about automatically discovered MVC and WebAPI project routes and route templates.
- `/actuator/metrics`: App CLR and HTTP metrics collected using OpenTelemetry library.
- `/actuator/prometheus`: A copy of the metrics endpoint, in a Prometheus friendly format.
- `/actuator/refresh`: Trigger the appâ€™s IConfigurationRoot to automatically refresh all configuration values.
- `/actuator/httptrace`: Details about the last few request traces made by the app.

## Stop the application

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

Either close the browser window or click the red stop button in the top menu.

# [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

Use the key combination "ctrl+c" on windows/linux or "cmd+c" on Mac.

## Summary

Similar to the previous exercise, there is a minimum expectation of any microserivce running in the cloud. These things are meant to help the developer debug, trace, and observe the application within its container. But these things have the potential to consume the developer's time creating everything, adding the right options, and making it distributable. Steeltoe aims to use the best in .NET to get the developer back to coding business logic and not deal with the boilerplate stuff.
