# Dynamic Logging

Steeltoe adds a Logging provider to the set of available logging packages in order to support the Steeltoe Management Logger endpoint.

When used with the Steeltoe Logger Management endpoint, this package enables dynamically changing the logging levels for running applications with the [TAS Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/console/index.html) on Cloud Foundry.
