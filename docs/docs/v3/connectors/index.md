# Service Connectors

Steeltoe Service Connectors simplify the process of connecting to, using and monitoring backing services. Steeltoe Connectors are primarily a bonding layer between your infrastructure and your application. Connectors don't directly manipulate the connection to backing resources, but do contain logic for turning raw credentials into formatted connection strings and also provide health monitoring tools.
